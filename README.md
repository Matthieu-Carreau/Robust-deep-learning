# Robust-deep-learning

During the MVA course "Foundations of deep learning", some classes were dedicated to robustness of deep learning (https://thome.isir.upmc.fr/classes/MVA/index.html).
They included three lab sessions, in which some template notebooks were provided.
This repository contains my work on these notebooks on Bayesian Linear Regression, Approximate inference, and Uncertainty Applications.
